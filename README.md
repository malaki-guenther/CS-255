# CS-255

The DriverPass project creates a cloud based system to improve driver training and reduce DMV test failures by enabling customers to register, schedule, modify, or cancel lessons, access online classes, and track progress. DMV integration is included for real-time updates, while role based access for users exsists for monitoring and controlling the program, including a customer, admin, IT, and secretary role. I did well in crafting clear UML diagrams, and ensuring security and scalability, but would revise the limitations section in the project requirements section to include mitigation strategies like offline access or phased car tracking. By interpreting user needs from the interview transcript and prioritizing usability, I ensured alignment with DriverPass’s mission, and in the future, I’d use usercentered design, prototyping, agile methods, and automated testing to create a more adaptable, user focused system.
